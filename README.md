# Windows-Lockscreen-Wallpaper

Do you like the background image that Windows sat as your lockscreen and you want to save it before it changes?

### Used libraries
- os
- shutil
- tkinter

All of them should be already built-in in your python version

Procedure
----
1. Launch the script "windows_images_retreiver.py", select a folder in which all the images will be saved 
(I suggest you to create a new folder since there will be many images)
